# Live coding task

### The task

Your task is to create an AI-based assistant that uses the files found in the **flat** folder to answer questions and make suggestions.

 * The assistant should always cite its answers with a link to the precise snippet in the original document, if a document was used
 * How you interact with the assistant does not matter. It can be a CLI tool.

### Parameters

 * You are free to use any and all tools you wish
 * Explain what you are doing and your reasoning
 * You do not need to deploy your solution anywhere, it just needs to be running locally
